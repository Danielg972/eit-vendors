# Israel Suppliers Master List: decisions

Decisions that bind this project. Newest first. Each entry says who decided, when, and on what evidence.

## D-1 · Vendor Master / Cockpit boundary (approved)

**Decided by:** Daniel (Eretz Israel Tours), in the Vendor Master Claude session, 1 October 2026, about 16:20 Israel time.
**Evidence:** Independent Reviewer return `EIT_VENDOR_MASTER_REVIEWER_RETURN_2026_10_01.md`, Drive file id `1FmgByjj2GQG8o2BvPNkTgvCTePqgr2-0`, in the Builder's Cockpit control folder. The return authorises nothing by itself; this decision is Daniel's.

**The boundary (reviewer's wording, approved as written):**

> Vendor Master is the canonical source for reusable supplier identity and dated reference evidence. The Cockpit is the canonical source for trip-applied supplier costs and trip quote state. The Cockpit may later read Vendor Master data one-way and offer it to Daniel; applying a price creates a trip-local snapshot with provenance. No Vendor Master change may silently alter an existing trip.

**Owner clarification (Daniel, 1 October 2026, 16:27 Israel time), in his words:**

> Yes — I approve the boundary: the Vendor Master is the source for reusable supplier identity and dated reference prices; the Cockpit is the source for trip-applied prices and trip-specific quotes. Any later Cockpit use of Vendor Master data is one-way and user-triggered; applying a price copies it into the trip with provenance, and later Vendor Master changes never silently alter that trip.
> No active R5 use — keep the R5 export as legacy/backup only and do not develop it further.

**What this means here:**

- The two apps stay separate. There is no shared database and no periodic batch copy.
- This app keeps every price line dated and sourced (`source`, `checked_on`, `updated_at`). A newer price is added or edited here. It never reaches into a trip.
- Trip quotes for real clients stay in the Cockpit. Quotes here are reference only and carry no client or trip details.
- The R5 export is **frozen as a legacy backup tool**: no more work on it. It is not the integration path. Daniel confirmed he has **no active R5 use**.
- **Not authorised by this decision:** any integration code, new cross-system ID fields, or export formats aimed at the Cockpit. The first integration work, when separately authorised, is a supplier identity map plus a written contract and verifier. Those come only after v4.97 is deployed and v4.98 is closed.
- Not touched: the Cockpit's frozen v4.97 deployment path and its authorised v4.98 closure work.

**Recorded on the Vendor Master side:** this file, `docs/STATUS.md`, the README "Change rules", and the updated `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` (section 8).
**For the Cockpit side (Steward's job, not done from here):** record the decision in the owner authorisations log, and add the thin cross-system status pointer to the Cockpit control folder.

**Follow-ups Daniel approved in the same decision, done 1 Oct 2026:**

1. Database structure saved in the repo (`supabase/schema.sql`) and edge-function source (`supabase/functions/files/index.ts`).
2. Status file for the Steward (`docs/STATUS.md`).
3. R5 export frozen and relabelled "Legacy R5 export (backup only)" in the Review tab.
4. Brief and skills list updated (`docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`).
